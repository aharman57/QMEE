This data comes from pilot studies I have completed for my MSc project. I am working with Lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and looking at the effect on elevated embyronic incubation temperatures on their temperature preference later in life. I use an instrument called a 'shuttle box' that exposes the fish to changing temperatures over time and several behavioral characteristics are quantified. "Shuttlesoft" is a program that came with the shuttle box system, and it calculates temperature preference every second based on the median occupied temperature of the fish. The .txt that it produces does not have a time variable, rather each data point represents a second of time during the experiment. The two columns of data that I use most often are Object temperature [ｰC], and Preferred temperature [ｰC]. If I take the median of object temperature it will give the preffered temperature. This was a pilot study, so I only tested one treatment group (control) instead of comparing between treatments. Ultimately I will be testing whether warmer temperatures caused by nuclear power plant thermal effluent can have lasting effects on developing Lake Whitefish embryos. Will they have altered temperature preferences later in life? 

Previously I was running 12hour experiments and breaking up the data into smaller chunks for analysis, so I will try to repeat this process in R. I am trying to optimize my experimental design by reducing the duration of the study, but there is a tradeoff between the amount of data collected (experiment length) and the variability in temperature preference. So I compared larger experiments (12hour) to shorter ones (2hour) by subsetting the data.
