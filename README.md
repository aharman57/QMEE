This data comes from pilot studies I have completed for my MSc project. I am working with Lake whitefish (Coregonus clupeaformis) and looking at the effect on elevated embyronic incubation temperatures on their temperature preference later in life. I use an instrument called a 'shuttle box' that exposes the fish to changing temperatures over time and several behavioral characteristics are quantified. "Shuttlesoft" is a program that came with the shuttle box system, and it calculates temperature preference every second based on the median occupied temperature of the fish. The .txt that it produces does not have a time variable, rather each data point represents a second of time during the experiment. The two columns of data that I use most often are Object temperature [ｰC], and Preferred temperature [ｰC]. If I take the median of object temperature it will give the preffered temperature. This was a pilot study, so I only tested one treatment group (control) instead of comparing between treatments. Ultimately I will be testing whether warmer temperatures caused by nuclear power plant thermal effluent can have lasting effects on developing Lake Whitefish embryos. Will they have altered temperature preferences later in life? 

Previously I was running 12hour experiments and breaking up the data into smaller chunks for analysis, so I will try to repeat this process in R. I am trying to optimize my experimental design by reducing the duration of the study, but there is a tradeoff between the amount of data collected (experiment length) and the variability in temperature preference. So I compared larger experiments (12hour) to shorter ones (2hour) by subsetting the data. 


Week 2 Assignment: 

I essentially plan on using all of the data output by Shuttlesoft to calculate a single value: temperature preference. I may involve other variables in a linear regression later on (if a relationship is found), but I am more concerned about comparing average temperature preference between treatment groups rather than investigating the cause of any difference. I will be testing developmental treatments with my experiment, so the conditions I am exposing the fish to in the shuttle box isn't really the "treatment" but more of a behavioral assay to assess temperature preference. 

So right now I am simply looking at comparing means (of temperature preference) between 3 treatment groups (n=30). Each fish will produce a .txt file that will be summarized in a temperature preference valule (in R). One R script will be used for cleaning/prepping the .txt files, mean temperature preference and associated variation calculated from the .txt files will be stored in a separate csv. Since my data is repeated measures from a single individual over time, it is essentailly pseudoreplication. Because of this I am having a little difficulty describing and comparing the variability (its not technically error) between treatment groups, which will be the bulk of my analysis. I need a way to compare the variability observed between trails (between fish) and the variation in the occupied temperature during a single trial (within fish) to get a better handle on the spread of the data. 

I think I am going to talk to my supervisor and try to get another dataset to use for the class. I like using my own, but there are only a few specific things that I want to do to it.. which is giving me a bit of tunnel vision. I think a new dataset that requires more manipulation and analysis might be better for this course.
